Terminally, How to build infrastructure

Problem with traditional IT approach
- pay for the rent for the data center
- pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
- adding and replacing hardware takes time
- scaling is limited
- hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
- how to deal with disasters? (earthquakes, power shutdown, fire...)
- can we externalize all this ?

What is cloud computing ?

- Cloud computing is the on-demond delivery of compute power, data base storage appications and other IT resources
- Through a cloud service platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
- you can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- you can access as any resources as you need, almost instantly
- simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services

- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these appliciation services, while you provision and use what you need via web application
