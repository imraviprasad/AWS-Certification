section : What is Cloud Computing 

1. How websites work
A client using network will send request to the server where both will find each other using the ip address.

2. What is a server composed of?
Compute: CPU
Memory: RAM
Storage: DATA(in binary)
DAtabase: Store data in a structured way
Network: Routers, Swicth, DNS server

3. IT Terminology

Network: cables, routers adn servers connected with each other
Router: Anetworking device that forward data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet.
Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server/client on your network

Terminally, How to build infrastructure

Problem with traditional IT approach
- pay for the rent for the data center
- pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
- adding and replacing hardware takes time
- scaling is limited
- hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
- how to deal with disasters? (earthquakes, power shutdown, fire...)
- can we externalize all this ?

What is cloud computing ?

- Cloud computing is the on-demond delivery of compute power, data base storage appications and other IT resources
- Through a cloud service platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
- you can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- you can access as any resources as you need, almost instantly
- simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services

- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these appliciation services, while you provision and use what you need via web application

The Deployment models of the cloud

- Private Cloud eg: rackspace
- Public Cloud eg: azure, google cloud, aws
- Hybride cloud eg: keep some servers on premises and extent some capabilities to cloud

The Five characteristics fo cloud computing

- On-Demand self service:
 - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the srvice provider
- Broad network access:
 - Resources availabel ovee the network and can be accessed by diverse client patform
- Multi-tenancy adn resource pooling:
 - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
 - Multiple customers are serviced from the sam ephysical resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
 - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
 - Quickly and easily scale on demand
- Measured service:
 - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
